This is likely because something is causing Pygame to quit prematurely or the `screen` surface is being invalidated. A common cause is the game loop exiting and then attempting to draw outside of the active game loop context. Let's try a different approach for the game over state: instead of a separate block after the loop, integrate the game over display *within* the loop, controlled by the `running` variable. When `running` becomes `False`, we can switch to rendering a game over screen instead of the normal game state.\n",
